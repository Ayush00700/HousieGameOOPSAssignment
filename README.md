# 1 Clone the repository

`
- git clone https://github.com/Ayush00700/HousieGameOOPSAssignment.git
`

# 2 Check your JDK Version and Java Version. I used `JavaSE-16` for Java and `jdk-16.0.1.9-hotspot` as my present JDK for this project. Also please prefer `VSCode` to `Eclipse`, as the former was used for creating this code.

# 3 Copy all .java Files 
(There are 11 .java files)

```
- Copy all the.java files to the root directory and run the following commands on terminal.

`javac Moderator.java`
`java Moderator`
```
